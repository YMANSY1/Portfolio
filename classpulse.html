												<h3>About the Project</h3>
											</header>
											<p>The biggest project I have ever worked on and my first major freelancing gig! Class Pulse is an app that
												works to leverage ChatGPT to generate personalised questions and help teachers correct assignments and 
												quizzes by providing feedback. The project consists of 2 apps, one for students and parents and another
												for teachers. The teacher app allows assigning homeworks with the use of AI and correcting assignments,
												also giving the option to assign personalised revision depending on each students' individual weaknesses.
												The student and parents app allows tracking of exams and assignments, chatting between students, and solving
												assignments by teachers with grades being recorded on the app.

												<h3>Assigning Questions</h3>
											</header>
											<p>The teacher may manually assign the questions or assign them using AI. There are several variations of this screen
												based off of the type of assignment the teacher wants to assign. When the AI is done assigning the questions, the
												teacher has the option of reviewing, editing, and picking the questions they need. Foregoing the use of AI and manually
												assigning questions is also on the table, providing a degree of flexibility to the teachers and more control over their
												work.

											<p>
												The ability to add questions using ChatGPT is here, only using a prompt may the teacher add the questions they need of
												any type. Questions may be essay, MCQ, fill-in-the-blank, short answer, etc. The teacher may also assign chat and voice
												assignments, allowing students to talk to chatgpt and get feedback based of their conversational skills.

												<h3>Student App</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
												The student app allows social interaction between students, parents, and teachers. It mainly also allows students and
												parents to track performance and interact with assignments by the teachers. Shown here is a dashboard allowing students to
												see the assignment they should do, their deadline, their type, and their title. The student may press the assignment and 
												solve it and submit it for correction.

												<h3>Final thoughts</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
												This project allowed me to work with a dynamic and passionate team seeking to innovate
												in the rising field of AI and leverages ChatGPT in a very creative and useful way to 
												streamline the jobs of both teacher and students. I learned Firebase as a backend service
												expanding my abilities alongside my previous experience with Supabase; in addition, I 
												also learned how to interact with Figma designs and convert Figma designs into responsive
												and attractive Flutter UI. Finally, I learned MVVM architecture and how to make robust and 
												maintainable code for use by my team. Working on this project has been a transformative
												experience for my career and increased my confidence and abilities exponentially!
